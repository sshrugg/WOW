There was a time I was convinced that I was king
As if the planet's belly burned for me
just to give my breakfast heat
When it occurred to me
I hadn't seen many other thing
So I packed up my roots and leaves
And raked all my fires clean
I rode a bird into the sky
To the first place near a star that caught my eye
Oh, I might never find a home again
But at least I get to choose my end
Before too long I found other kings
And strangers that did likewise menial things
Already your footsteps have a special kind of ring
A secret kind of music that gives everything I need
I'm learning to be patient, because patience is the key
When I stop behaving like a hunter, you'll move closer yet to me
There were explosions in the sky
I could swear that I just heard my poor rose cry
Oh, I might never make it home again
But at least I know I've found a friend
And I would rather be here taming you
In this desert where dreams are real
And right now I'm dreaming of you
